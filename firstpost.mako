[quote]Physicists were still far removed from such a way of thinking: space was still, for them, a rigid, homogeneous something, susceptible of no change or conditions. [b][color=darkblue]Only the genius of Riemann[/color][/b], solitary and uncomprehended, had already won its way by the middle of the last century to a new conception of space, in which space was deprived of its rigidity, and in which its power to take part in physical events was recognized as possible.

Bernhard Riemann was one of the most influential mathematicians from the past few centuries. His name pops up everywhere from precalculus textbooks to unsolvable* math mysteries to The Simpsons! In celebration of his 196th birthday, PrimeGrid will have a [b]3-day[/b] challenge on the [u][color=blue][b][url=https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=9436]WW[/url][/b][/color][/u] subproject from [color=green][b]17 September 20:00 UTC[/b][/color] to [color=green][b]20 September 20:00 UTC[/b][/color].

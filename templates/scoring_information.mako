[u][b]Scoring Information[/b][/u]

Scores will be kept for individuals and teams.  Only tasks issued AFTER ${start} and received BEFORE ${end} will be considered for credit.  We will be using the same scoring method as we currently use for BOINC credits. A quorum of 2 is [b]NOT[/b] needed to award Challenge score - i.e. no double checker. Therefore, each returned result will earn a Challenge score.  Please note that if the result is eventually declared invalid, the score will be removed.

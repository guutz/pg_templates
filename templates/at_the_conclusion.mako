[u][b]At the Conclusion of the Challenge[/b][/u]
[list]We kindly ask users "moving on" to ABORT their tasks instead of DETACHING, RESETTING, or PAUSING.

ABORTING tasks allows them to be recycled immediately; thus a much faster "clean up" to the end of a Challenge. DETACHING, RESETTING, and PAUSING tasks causes them to remain in limbo until they EXPIRE. Therefore, we must wait until tasks expire to send them out to be completed.

Please consider either [b]completing what's in the queue[/b] or ABORTING them. Thank you. :)

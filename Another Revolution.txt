Kirk. President. KAT Dolores Moynihan. Secretary to the Research Dean. HENRY KAT Columbia University. Columbia University. TRANSITION: "LIGHT MY FIRE" BY THE DOORS SCENE 1 -JANUARY 22, 1968 A science lab. Poorly outfitted, with plants strewn about in an organized chaos. There are a few desks, a radio, a record player. Off to the side, there's an empty chalkboard. KAT is the lab's only occupant. She's sorting, measuring, and preparing bean seeds to be planted. She eats a Twizzler as she works. In the background, a record plays. Edgy for early 1968. The Doors. The Velvet Underground. When the Beatles got weird. The lab door opens and HENRY enters. He wears suspenders, or maybe a really dweeby vest. He stands there for a long time, unnoticed and unsure of what to do. He doesn't belong here. Or... maybe he does? Finally, Kat catches a glimpse of him. KAT Jesus Christ!... (she takes the needle off the record player) Can I help you? HENRY Yes. Uh... Yes. Is this 604? KAT If you're looking for Dr. Graham, he's not here. HENRY Oh. No. Uh. Not Dr. Graham. No. I'm just... I'm looking for 604. KAT You've found it. HENRY Are you sure, because, then... I think maybe you shouldn't be here. KAT Okay. Do you have a name? Address? Return to sender label? HENRY Henry. I'm Henry. Satterfield. Henry spots an otherwise unclaimed desk, unloads his books. KAT Whoa. Okay. Um... What do you think you're doing? HENRY They didn't, uh... The university. They didn't mention me? KAT The university and I aren't exactly on speaking terms. At the moment. HENRY Well... I think this is my lab. KAT Ha. No. (she shoves Henry’s books back into his arms) This is Dr. Graham's lab. And he doesn't like strangers, or students, or anyone, not even me, and he's my advisor. So, why exactly are you here? HENRY I'm in theoretical physics. Astrophysics and cosmology. The PhD program. KAT That's in Pupin. This is Havemeyer. HENRY Right, but-.KAT Pupin's around the corner. Two lefts and you'll walk right smack into it. HENRY They didn't tell me Pupin, they told me Havemeyer. KAT Then, they must have made a mistake. HENRY (double checking his papers) ...I don't think so. KAT Look. This is an actual science lab. It's not theoretical. We have explosions. Sometimes. HENRY Botanical explosions? KAT We have had explosions. In the past. HENRY The Big Bang was an explosion. KAT If it doesn't happen in a petri dish, then it's not an explosion that happens in this lab. HENRY Okay. But, uh... they don't have room for me in Pupin. KAT Oh, no. Sorry. We're full. HENRY Doesn't look it... KAT I don't need a lab partner. HENRY Right, no, I don't either, but... Havemeyer. 604. It's... He holds out his piece of paper. She takes it and reads. HENRY See? It's right there. Kat glares at the paper. Ultimate administrative betrayal. Henry takes the paper back from her. HENRY O-kay... He settles into his newly claimed desk, slowly clearing all the plants from what is now his tiny, orderly corner of the lab. HENRY So, uh... there sure are a lot of plants in here. KAT Are you new? HENRY Sorry? KAT Because I know everyone here. Even the physicists. And I've never seen you. HENRY Oh. Uh... Yeah. I guess so. KAT Did you transfer from somewhere? HENRY Not exactly. KAT But it's January. HENRY Right. KAT So where'd you come from? HENRY Dartmouth. Or, well... no. From Westchester, I guess? This morning. KAT Normal people start in September. HENRY Not always. KAT But usually. HENRY But not always. KAT But usually. HENRY Sometimes people start in January. It's not that strange. KAT You're a scientist, then. (tasting every syllable) A theoretical physicist. HENRY Well, I will be. Once I graduate. KAT And how long is that gonna take? HENRY Approximately 6 to 8 years. ... KAT I've got a few ground rules. If you're gonna be here. I have rules. Lab rules. HENRY Okay... KAT Number 1. Do not touch the plants. HENRY I won't touch anything / I was just... KAT Plants, seeds, water samples, soil samples... Do not touch. Got it? HENRY Yes. KAT Number 2. Do not touch my records. HENRY Are you allowed to have records / in a lab? KAT Do not touch them. HENRY Okay. KAT Number 3. The candy is mine. If you eat it, I will know. So don't try anything. HENRY I don't even like licorice. KAT Good. ... HENRY Is that, uh... all of them? The rules? KAT For now. Kat takes a threatening bite of her Twizzler. They eye each other nervously. For a long time. HENRY Are you from Barnard? KAT No. I'm not an undergrad, if that's what you're implying. HENRY I wasn't-.KAT They let girls get doctorates here. We're not all June Cleaver homemaker robots. Some of us are scientists. HENRY It's just unusual, / that's all... KAT Yeah, I've noticed, thanks. ... HENRY Who's your favorite scientist? KAT I don't have to prove myself to you. HENRY It's just a question. KAT Rachel Carson. HENRY Interesting. KAT She is interesting! HENRY I know. That's what I said. ... KAT Who's your favorite? HENRY Sir Isaac Newton. KAT That is so boring. HENRY Newton's not boring. He's got the laws of motion. Gravity... He's got a unit named after him. KAT Just like a man to slap his name on a unit of applied force. HENRY What? KAT Nothing. They fall into another awkward silence. Henry pulls the chalkboard out from the back of the room. HENRY Can I have this? KAT Yeah, make yourself at home. Henry starts to write on the chalkboard, claiming it as his own. … KAT You know what else is shit about Newton? HENRY No? KAT He had a nervous breakdown and he died a virgin. HENRY (ignoring this entire detour) Between 1665 and 1667, Cambridge University was closed because of the Black Plague, and that's when Newton developed his famous theory of optics. KAT Cool. (...) But, fun facts don't make you a scientist. HENRY I'm not a fraud. KAT I'm just saying. Trivia isn't exactly practical application. HENRY So... what? I'd be more of a scientist if I liked explosions? KAT Maybe. HENRY Boys who like explosions end up dead in Vietnam. KAT Ohhhhhhhhh. I see. HENRY See what? KAT Starting in January. No room for you in Pupin... You're just here for the draft deferral. ... HENRY You know what, we don't have to talk. KAT Fine by me. HENRY I'll stay over here with my chalkboard and you stay over there with your plants, and we can just... ignore each other. Like quantum mechanics and general relativity. You take care of the atoms, I'll worry about the black holes, and we'll both just continue to exist despite our increasingly irreconcilable differences. ... KAT I don't think you're a fraud. HENRY Good, because I'm not. KAT I get it. I mean, whatever, it's fine. (...) My brother burned his draft card. HENRY Why'd he do that? KAT It's pointless, really. They've got a database. The card doesn't mean anything. Henry pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He lights one. KAT Oh, whoa! No, no, no, no, no. You absolutely cannot smoke in here. Kat snatches his cigarette and stamps it out on the table. HENRY Why not? KAT Okay. First of all, these are terrible for you. Not that I care. About you. Second, and more importantly, you're compromising the controlled environment of MY LAB. HENRY I thought it was Dr. Graham's lab. KAT Rule Number 4. No. Smoking. HENRY Does Dr. Graham know about all these rules? KAT He's not here. He's a million years old and he's been tenured since 1902, so... he wobbles in every once in a while to pass judgement on how my beans are growing, but other than that he leaves me here to beg for funding and ward off theoretical physicists. HENRY ...I guess you're not doing a very good job, then. KAT Obviously. ... HENRY So, uh... What was your name again? KAT It's Katherine. Kat. HENRY Like... Kitty? Kitty Kat? KAT Do not call me Kitty. HENRY Why not? KAT Because I told you not to. HENRY Okay. Kat, only. Katherine, formally. Never Kitty. Got it. Kat walks over to the record player and gets the music going again. The Velvet Underground. "Run Run Run". HENRY Do we have to have the music? Kat shoots him a dagger glare. HENRY It's just that... I find it kind of distracting. KAT Then find another lab. But, there's nowhere else for him to go and they both know it. Henry turns back to his chalkboard and continues writing out some calculations. Kat hauls a sack of dirt onto a table. Back to work. TRANSITION: "RUN RUN RUN" BY THE VELVET UNDERGROUND SCENE 1.5 -A LETTER KAT Tuesday, January 30th, 1968. Dear Peter, New York is freezing, though I'm sure it's not as cold as home. I talked to Dad last week, and he's gearing up for one of his famous Ohio winters. So, you're not missing anything. Just Dad and his endless struggle with the ice scraper. School is fine... I'm growing jade this term. Separate from the beans. I got a ton of it free when I bought my fertilizer. I have no idea what I’m gonna do with it. And I've been listening to this band called the Velvet Underground. They're really weird. Next time I see you we'll play the whole record straight through. You’re gonna love it, and Mom’s gonna want to strangle us. That's all I've got to say, really. Everything's the same here. Except I've got this hitchhiker in my lab for the semester. The kid's a nerd. You'd hate him. I miss you something awful. -Kitty. TRANSITION: "I THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW" BY TOMMY JAMES & THE SHONDELLS SCENE 2 -FEBRUARY 9, 1968 Henry is alone in the lab. Kat's plants are looking more like an actual experiment now. Small green seedlings under fluorescent lights. But Henry's not interested in the plants. He's smoking a cigarette, carefully blowing the smoke out an open window. He finishes the cigarette and drifts over to the record player. He checks behind him to make sure Kat isn't anywhere to be found (she's not) and starts flipping through her collection. Not this. Not that. Then... The Velvet Underground & Nico. He sets the needle down and lets it play for a few seconds before realizing that it's definitely not his style. It's "The Black Angel's Death Song," probably. Weird ass shit. Kat enters, pulling off her winter gear. KAT God, it stinks to high heaven out there. // Henry takes the needle off the record in a hurry. Swats away the smoke. KAT // Morris let us out early since Mudd smells like low tide, but... She notices Henry still holding the album sleeve. KAT What are you doing? HENRY Nothing. I'm not doing anything. KAT Because it looks like you've got your grubby hands on my Velvet Underground album. HENRY Oh. I, uh... I was just curious. KAT Give me that. She takes the record from him. HENRY Where have you been all morning? KAT Class. Ever heard of it? HENRY I go to class. Sometimes. KAT Jesus. You're like a bad rash. Annoying. Incurable. Ever-present. HENRY It's my lab, too. KAT Don't remind me. (she peers out the window) How much longer can this last? I mean, sanitation workers deserve fair wages. I am very pro... that. Pro-Union. That's how I grew up. And everyone in SDS is all for it, that's what our whole meeting was about last week. But... 8 days? All my plants are gonna suffocate on garbage! And the streets look like we've been hit by a meteor. (...) You're into space, right? When I say meteor, I mean... it's a metaphor. HENRY I know. KAT It's so disgusting. I could barf. ... HENRY I saw a rat yesterday. KAT ...Okay? HENRY I thought it was unusual. KAT You've never seen a rat before? HENRY Well, I saw one yesterday. KAT For the first time? HENRY It was bigger than I thought it would be. KAT You really need to get out more. Henry's regretting this conversation already. HENRY You, uh... You got some mail earlier. KAT What? Where? HENRY I left it over on the... Kat rifles through the small pile of mail. HENRY Are you expecting something? Because, if you're expecting something, / you should just let me... KAT Do not touch my mail. HENRY Is that a rule, or...? KAT It's not a rule. It's a federal crime. HENRY That's just if you open it. KAT Good to know. She rips open a letter. She reads. KAT Oh shit. (more excited now) Oh SHIT! HENRY Are you okay? KAT I am wonderful. HENRY You are? KAT It's an application for the Butler Fellowship. Addressed to me. HENRY Oh. Yeah, I got one too. KAT What?! How did you get one? HENRY It came in the mail. KAT If you're a Butler Fellow, they cover all your expenses for 5 years. Tuition. Lab fees. Room and board. They don't just hand out applications. You have to qualify. HENRY I'm qualified. KAT You've only been here for 3 weeks. HENRY I'm really smart. KAT Okay, Wonder Boy. What are you gonna submit? HENRY Oh. Uh. My theory. It's about orbits. Galactic orbits. I specialize in orbits. KAT Like the earth around the sun? HENRY No. Well, yes. But, no. I'm not interested in the earth. Our solar system is fairly unexciting. KAT Right... Obviously. HENRY But, galactic orbits. Now, that is interesting. Because planets orbit stars, but stars orbit a galactic center which is, most likely, in the case of our galaxy, a supermassive black hole that emits this intense astronomical radio signal. Galactocentric orbits are... they're fascinating. And my theory revolves around this thought experiment, which... well, a thought experiment is a theoretical situation and its resulting calculations. The twin paradox, for example. Or Schrödinger's cat. And mine is about what would happen, theoretically, if the black hole in the center of our galaxy, or any galaxy, just... disappeared. Even though that wouldn't ever happen. But, if it did. What would happen. (...) Neat, right? KAT So, you're not even doing an actual experiment. You're just thinking about an experiment. HENRY Essentially. KAT Does that even count as science? HENRY Exploring the laws of physics on a cosmic level aids in our understanding of the universe-.KAT But, why? You're spending all this time on intergalactic orbits // HENRY It's galactic, not intergalactic. KAT // and black holes but couldn't you study something that's actually relevant to people on Earth? HENRY Intergalactic orbits require a whole other set of calculations to determine the geometry of spacetime. KAT Look. You're an interesting kid. But, when I look at this... whatever this is, it makes me think you should be in the math building, not Havemeyer. HENRY This is science. KAT Science requires a method. Hypothesis, experimentation, observation, conclusion. You're missing a lot of those. I mean, you don't even have a telescope. HENRY You don't need a telescope to study cosmology. KAT So, what do you need? A ruler? A thermometer? A speedometer? You must need something. HENRY Just your brain. KAT That can't be true. HENRY It's an elevated type of theoretical science. Logic based, mostly. Looking for answers to bigger questions than how long does it take for this or that seed to grow. KAT Is that what you think I'm doing? HENRY ...Isn't it? KAT Wow. Your head is really far up your ass, you know that? HENRY Excuse me? KAT What's happening here, in this lab that you so gracefully barged into with all your imaginary thought experiments, is an actual experiment that will yield measurable results, which will then find their way into my very solid and tangible 20-page winning application for the Butler Science Fellowship. HENRY Okay... KAT A theory! Theories are a topic you're familiar with, so here's a good one. The global temperature is expected to increase by 1 degree centigrade over the next 50 years. Which doesn't sound like much, but we're talking about a lot of very fragile ecosystems, and we just keep pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so our planet is getting hotter. HENRY I thought it was getting colder. KAT Absolutely not. HENRY I read that there could be another ice age. KAT That is dumb and you shouldn't trust everything you read. HENRY Are you sure, / because it's... KAT I am sure. Now stop interrupting. // HENRY ...Okay. KAT // Plants breathe in CO2, so if there's more CO2 in the atmosphere, what does that mean for phenotypical plant development? Nutritional content? Ecosystem interactions? This is a life or death question. HENRY So... you're growing plants under different temperatures so you can see how they grow differently? KAT It’s a lot more complicated than that. HENRY But that’s the general idea? KAT …Yes. HENRY Well... a middle schooler could do that. It's not very challenging. KAT Look. In a hundred years, everyone's gonna be really thankful that I was doing this experiment, because there will be data, and there will be facts, and I will have contributed to them. HENRY It just seems very small. KAT You know what... I'm sorry I brought it up. HENRY I didn't mean / to offend you. KAT No, it's fine. HENRY But... do you actually think you can win? KAT Oh. I can win. HENRY Has a girl ever won a Butler Fellowship? KAT Not yet. HENRY I wouldn't get your hopes up. KAT Wow. That's insulting. HENRY I'm just being honest. KAT So, what are you trying to say? Honestly? HENRY Just that it's unlikely. For a girl to win. Statistically, / traditionally... KAT No, whatever. You're probably right. HENRY I am right. KAT Yeah. But... that's exactly what everyone told me when I applied to get into this school. And, here I am, so... screw your universal laws. HENRY Not necessarily. KAT Yeah, okay. HENRY Newton's first law. KAT Not again with Newton, / I mean, really... HENRY An object in motion will stay in motion at a constant velocity and in the same direction unless acted upon by an outside force. (...) The outside force... it's you. It's a metaphor. KAT That is very weird and strangely nice of you. HENRY Thanks. KAT But, I will crush you. So we're clear. HENRY I don't really think so. But, I guess we'll see. KAT Then may the best man win. Kat holds out her hand for a handshake. They shake hands. TRANSITION: "THE LETTER" BY THE BOX TOPS SCENE 2.5 -SOME FIELD NOTES HENRY February 29th, 1968. Leap Day. Dear Universe, It takes exactly 365.2564 days for the Earth to orbit the sun. One revolution. This orbit has been stable and constant for 4.5 billion years, and the fact that we exist within a serene and orderly orbit is almost as unlikely as the fact that we exist at all. Elsewhere in the vast intergalactic cosmos, planetary orbits can be so violent that their collisions result in massive shockwaves that tear through the fabric of space and time. But, I didn't have to tell you that. You're the Universe. It can seem almost cruel though. To be tucked away with our safe orbit around our safe star, while other planets get swallowed whole by unseen forces. But then... maybe we are so special, so unlikely, so singular and precious, that you couldn't bear to put us in harm's way. Maybe we are destined for something truly important. Maybe we have to be. To deserve any of it at all. I don't expect an answer. But I am, as ever, yours, Henry. TRANSITION: "I FOUGHT THE LAW" BY THE BOBBY FULLER FOUR SCENE 3 -MARCH 28, 1968 Kat's bean plants have grown tall and green. Henry reads a copy of the latest Columbia Daily Spectator. Kat’s pacing. She's eating candy. Loudly. As she eyes Henry impatiently. KAT Are you almost done? HENRY I'm reading. KAT Okay, well, you're taking forever. HENRY You could buy your own Spectator. They have them all over campus. KAT Yeah, but why would I waste my nickel when I could just read yours. Kat squeezes next to him to get a look at the newspaper. Henry extracts himself from behind the desk, taken aback and extremely uncomfortable. Kat looks at him. Snaps her gum. KAT What is your problem? HENRY I don't have a problem. I just... I don't like to be that close to other people. KAT You are a really bizarre person, you know that? HENRY I have been told that. Several times, actually. By you. KAT Anyway... This is not good. (reading from the paper) "Anti-IDA Demonstration in Low Library Called First Violation of Picketing Directive". Kirk's out for blood. HENRY At least you didn't get arrested. KAT They're threatening disciplinary action against a peaceful sit-in. That's unconstitutional, first of all, and I can't get suspended. I'll lose my Butler eligibility. HENRY I don't know why you're friends with those people. KAT Who, the SDS kids? HENRY They're not even scientists. KAT Some of them are. Phil. Danny. Me. I am. HENRY What about those girls? The Russian Lit girls. KAT You can study Tolstoy and still care about politics. He wrote this book called War and Peace, maybe you've heard of it? HENRY They're troublemakers. KAT You don't even know them. HENRY What about that guy, your leader... Mark Rudd? KAT Okay, well, Mark Rudd's a jerk but at least he gets things done. HENRY I just think it's a little extreme. KAT You wanna know what's extreme? This university being a member of the Institute for Defense Analyses. There's IDA government science leaking out of every crack in the concrete around here. I mean, where do you think the chemical warfare studies happen? They happen in Havemeyer. Mudd. Pupin. Dow Chemical's recruiting the entire chem department, looking for the next napalm. And Kirk... He encourages it. And that shouldn't be allowed to happen without resistance. HENRY I think you're overreacting. KAT This is about science. What science gets funded and whether military research can happen on this campus. And I'm a scientist. HENRY But, most of these people? 150 protesters in Low... It's an excuse for them. The war. The IDA. The gym in Morningside Park. It's just another cause to make a poster about. They're angry, but they're angry at nothing. KAT None of that is nothing. The war's not nothing. The IDA is not nothing. HENRY But it's not theirs. KAT Yeah, it's mine. And they're my friends. So, they show up for me, and I show up for them. That's what friends do. Maybe you would know that, if you had any. HENRY I have friends. KAT No, you don't. HENRY We're friends. KAT We're not friends. HENRY I have other friends. KAT Yeah? Who? The universe? HENRY ...You're making fun of me. KAT You're a scientist. You could be out there with us. You could have friends. HENRY I can't lose my Butler eligibility either. And protesting, it's just... it's not for me. KAT Wow. You are such a coward. HENRY It's a complex situation. KAT Yeah, no kidding. HENRY You wouldn't understand. KAT You don't know anything about me. ... HENRY My parents have a lot of money. KAT I'm shocked, truly. HENRY My father's a businessman. He's a... developer, I guess, is what you'd call it. Commercial real estate. My mother hosts parties, mainly. She owns a lot of shoes. And, I'm not very much like them. Much to their obvious confusion. But, my father's on the alumni committee. Class of 35. And President Kirk? He's been to dinner at my house. If it wasn't for him, I could be... KAT Back at Dartmouth? HENRY No. KAT Harvard? Yale? HENRY Vietnam. I could be in Vietnam. KAT You're not in Vietnam, though. You're here. HENRY Exactly. ... KAT Kirk is scum. HENRY That's not... no. KAT He's an elitist and a tyrant. HENRY That's not true at all. KAT I should be able to protest whatever I want, wherever I want. And I don't deserve to get suspended for it. HENRY You won't get suspended. KAT You don't know that. HENRY I can talk to Kirk, if you want... KAT No. Do not do that. HENRY I'm offering to help you. KAT Yeah, in a way that would undermine absolutely everything. HENRY I thought you didn't want to get suspended. KAT I don't! HENRY Then, why join the protest at all? KAT Because, I had to. HENRY You don't have to do anything. If you really wanted the Butler fellowship then maybe you'd stay out of it. ... KAT My brother used to go to these protests all the time. He would drive an hour away, all the way up to Cleveland. And he would make all these cardboard signs. He's a really good artist, he can draw anything, but... that's when he burned his draft card. At one of those protests. It made my dad so angry. They fought all night. But... he was just trying to change things. I'm trying to change things. HENRY Where's your brother now? Kat shrugs. HENRY Is he... KAT He's not dead, if that's what you're asking. HENRY Oh. KAT He's somewhere in Vietnam. Outside Vietnam. Who knows. (...) My dad's not on an alumni committee. He's a steelworker in Canton, Ohio. So, that's why my brother is over there fighting for... I don't know what. And you're here, keeping your head down and fighting for nothing. HENRY I didn't choose for it to be that way. KAT That doesn't make it fair. HENRY I guess not. ... KAT God. I can't get suspended. HENRY It's not really such a big deal. Getting suspended? It's not... Well, it's not like getting expelled. KAT Look. It wasn't easy for me to get into this school. I didn't call up one of my dad's old college buddies because I got tired of Dartmouth and have an acceptance letter magically arrive at my door. I had to fight to get here, and I'm hanging on by a thread. My advisor is senile, this lab has no funding, and I can't get a meeting with the research dean to save my life. I'm lucky I got that Butler application at all. No one thinks I belong here. You don't. You think my experiments are stupid and maybe they are, but this is everything I have. And maybe I'm disappointing everyone, even myself, but... it's hard enough the way it is. And this is everything I have. HENRY It's a complex situation. KAT Yeah. It's a complex situation. TRANSITION: "FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH" BY BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD SCENE 3.5 -A LETTER KAT Dear Kitty, By the time you read this it will probably be April. I'm sorry I haven't drawn you anything today. But, no dumb cartoon can show you what this place is really like. One of my buddies was killed yesterday. His birthday was June 5th, same as yours. I hope you don't mind me telling you that. But, it had me thinking about you, glad you're safe and far away from here. Don't worry about me too much. Just keep that jade growing. Jade's lucky. And luck is hard to come by these days. -Peter. TRANSITION: "IN THE DARK" BY NINA SIMONE SCENE 4 -APRIL 9, 1968 Kat's bean plants have started to flower now. Dainty, white flowers with a quiet, mocking happiness. Henry scribbles away at his chalkboard. But Kat is glued to the radio. Five days ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot dead in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of 39. Today is his funeral. The radio plays Benjamin Mays eulogy, which begins like this: "Let it be thoroughly understood, that our deceased brother did not embrace nonviolence out of fear or cowardice. Moral courage was one of his noblest virtues… Martin Luther King Jr. challenged the interracial injustice of his country without a gun, and he had faith to believe that he would win..." You can find audio excerpts of the eulogy here: americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/c1.html After several moments, Henry stops calculating. He stares at the chalkboard. Something's not adding up. He glares at Kat. At the radio. Like maybe it's their fault. HENRY Kat, it's been five days. (...) Kat? (...) Do we have to keep listening to this? It's relentless, / it's... KAT Will you please shut up? He does. For a moment. It doesn't last very long. HENRY Kat. (...) Kat! Henry walks over, snatches the radio, and switches it off. KAT Hey! Are you crazy? Turn it back on. HENRY I have work to do. KAT I don't care. HENRY I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE! A long beat of stinging silence. KAT How many black people live in Westchester? HENRY I've never noticed. KAT You tend to notice that sort of thing. Especially when people are murdering each other. HENRY There's nothing we can do about it. KAT I can't do nothing. I'm wired. I'm electric. I wanna burn something. HENRY And what good would that do? KAT I don't know! Aren't you angry? Aren't you sad? HENRY Sure. It's sad. It's very sad. KAT I didn't ask if it was sad. I asked if YOU were sad. HENRY Not really, but... it's not like I knew him. KAT That's bullshit. HENRY He was just one person. KAT Martin Luther King Jr. was not just one person. HENRY Every person is only one person. KAT Metaphorically. HENRY People die all the time. KAT Someone shot him. In the face. HENRY It's very sad. I said that already. KAT What is wrong with you? HENRY Nothing. KAT This is important. More important than your stupid calculations. HENRY Not to me. KAT How can you say that? HENRY You can't force people to care about things. You asked me a question, "are you sad", and I told you the truth, "no". You don't like my answer, and I'm sorry, I guess. But, I don't know how to make myself care about everything, because there's too much and it's too exhausting and I have too much work to do. ... KAT Sometimes I feel really sorry for you, you know that? HENRY Feelings are complicated. KAT Empathy shouldn't be complicated, it should be intuitive. HENRY It's not as clear as that. It's... Okay. Light is not a particle or a wave, and yet it is both a particle and a wave // KAT What does this have to do with anything? Oh my god. HENRY // because the behaviors of light are dependent upon how it is observed and measured. This is a basic tenet of quantum theory, Wave-Particle Duality. And, in the same way, we can experience sadness and also not, because it was a very sad thing but then Mark Rudd interrupts the memorial service to shout about Columbia mass-gentrifying Morningside Heights and mistreating black workers and how we're all complicit in that. So, it's both and neither. A logical conundrum, to be sure, which is why I stick to general relativity... lets you stay out of the whole mess. KAT You're gonna stay out of it? Just... stay out of it. Not engage with other people at all. HENRY That is the current plan. KAT You're not gonna say anything? HENRY I'm saying that it's sad. KAT Are you gonna vote? HENRY For what, the president? KAT Bobby Kennedy's running. Are you gonna vote for him? HENRY I'm not sure why that's relevant. KAT Voting is saying something. HENRY Then maybe I won't vote. KAT That is so stupid. HENRY Why? KAT Because it hurts people! When you say nothing. HENRY I don't think it does though. KAT Wow. Okay. Henry. Do you ever consider that you live in this world? When you're doing all your interstellar physics, I mean? Do you ever consider how important this planet is? HENRY Not really. KAT Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. HENRY I don't consider it because we're not important. This planet is... microscopic, really. It's not even the largest in our solar system. That's Jupiter, 12 hundred times our size. And then the sun... you could fit 1.3 million Earths inside our sun. And that's puny. The runt of the litter, as far as stars go. There are stars that are billions of times larger and denser than our sun. Blue giants. Red giants. Red supergiants. And every star belongs to a galaxy, which can contain hundreds of billions of stars. And that's just one galaxy. There are trillions of galaxies and superclusters of galaxies spread across an expanding and possibly infinite universe. And that makes it sound very exciting and crowded, but in reality space is just a lot of...space. Dark, silent, empty space that extends for trillions of light years. And we are nothing but an interesting and unusual but minuscule accident that is entirely insignificant in the vast expanse of space and time. KAT That is so depressing. HENRY I think it's kind of astonishing. ... KAT Here's the thing though. We're here. We are all here. Together. And we can't even figure out how to stop fucking killing each other. (...) Can I have the radio back? Please. After a moment, Henry hands it back to her. TRANSITION: "WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKENHEARTED" BY JIMMY RUFFIN SCENE 4.5 -A NOTE KAT April 19th, 1968. Henry .I'll be gone for a few days. HENRY Please water the plants. -Kat. TRANSITION: "SHE'S NOT THERE" BY THE ZOMBIES And then, into... radio static. Shouting. Chanting. Laughter. Singing. Alarms. More shouting. TRANSITION: A RADIO BROADCAST FROM WKCR... SCENE 5 -APRIL 26, 1968 The radio broadcast should be something like: "The building is completely barricaded. Nobody can get in or out. All the windows have been closed up. They are prepared to put up violent resistance on the fifth floor, and nonviolent resistance on the first floor..." You can find excerpts of the Columbia WKCR broadcast here: exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/protests/wkcr (especially around 8:47). As Henry works, he smokes a cigarette. Comfortable in the indulgence, not worried about getting caught. It's just him and the chalkboard. Then, the phone rings. Henry glances over at it. This thing rings? He stamps out his cigarette, turns off the radio, and picks up the phone. HENRY Hello? It's Kat on the other line, calling from a payphone. KAT Oh, thank god. Hey, it's me. HENRY If you're looking for Kat, she's not here. KAT Henry! This is Kat. HENRY Oh. Hi. Hi. Where are you? KAT It's kind of a long story. What's going on? HENRY Nothing really. Just finishing up some equations... KAT On campus, Henry. What's going on with the protest? It's all over the news. HENRY You're not...? I thought you might have been... Why are you asking me? KAT You're there, aren't you? HENRY Yes. KAT And...? HENRY And, what? KAT The protest, Henry. HENRY Right. It's, um... well, it's fairly loud. KAT Besides that. HENRY Classes are canceled for the rest of the week. I'm not even supposed to be in the lab right now. KAT Then what are you doing there? HENRY Working. KAT They're not occupying Havemeyer? HENRY Just Low and Hamilton so far. And Math, I think. KAT Math?! That's right next door. HENRY I know. KAT Shit... You cannot let them in the lab, okay? HENRY I thought they were your friends. KAT Promise. You cannot let them screw up my experiment. HENRY I won't. KAT Seriously, Henry. HENRY I won't! No one's here. I promise. KAT Okay. Fine. I believe you. ... HENRY Where have you been all week? KAT Do you think you could do me a favor? HENRY Um. Sure. I guess. What is it? KAT It's just... it's really important and I don't know who else to ask. HENRY I said yes. KAT The bean plants. They're all flowering right? Henry glances around. Yup, flowers everywhere. HENRY Yes. KAT I need someone to pollinate them. HENRY What? KAT I would have done it myself but... it really can't wait. It has to be this week, otherwise I'll miss the reproductive phase and the whole experiment will be worthless. And then my chance at the Butler Fellowship is history. So... I can talk you through it. If you wouldn't mind. And I would be really, really grateful. HENRY Uh... Yeah. Okay. I can do that. KAT Oh. Wow. Okay. Thank you. ... HENRY So... What am I supposed to do? KAT Right! Right, okay. There's a paintbrush on my desk. Skinny. Wooden handle. Do you see it? HENRY Yes. KAT Okay. To pollinate the flowers, you have to brush the anthers to get the pollen, and then brush the pollen onto the stigma of another flower. Do you follow me? HENRY Not really. KAT Okay, go look at a flower. HENRY Okay. KAT If you pull back the petals, do you see those little yellow pollen things? Maybe four or five of them? HENRY Yes. KAT Those are the anthers. Brush one to get some pollen on the paintbrush, and then go to another flower and put that pollen on the stigma, which is the sticky bit in the center. HENRY Anther to stigma. KAT Got it? HENRY Yeah, I think so. KAT Great, thank you so much. Henry carefully pollinates the flowers. Kat stays quiet. HENRY Hey, Kat? KAT Yeah? HENRY Where are you? If you're not here, with the protest... Where are you? KAT Oh. Um. I'm home. I'm in Canton. HENRY Why? (he lights another cigarette) ...Kat? KAT Yeah? HENRY Is everything okay? KAT Ha. Good question. (...) Shit. Hang on. I need another dime. Kat searches through her pockets for another coin to feed the payphone. She finds one and pushes it in. HENRY You're on a payphone? KAT Yeah. I couldn't be in the house for another second. And the phone's been ringing off the hook, so if I held up the line for even 5 minutes my mother would go absolutely apeshit crazy. HENRY Oh... What happened? KAT My brother's home. HENRY On leave, or...? KAT No. He has been... discharged. HENRY That's great. KAT Not really. HENRY Is he okay? KAT There was, uh... there was this explosion. So. He's not really okay. I mean, he'll be okay. But he's not really okay right now. HENRY Oh. I'm sorry. KAT He's just... different. Everything feels different. HENRY I'm sure he's glad to see you. KAT Yeah, I don't really know. HENRY I can, um... I can do this for you, though. Pollinate the flowers? I am taking care of it. Consider it done. KAT Thanks. A long beat. KAT I can tell you're smoking, you know. I can hear it. Henry stubs out the cigarette. HENRY I'm not smoking. Anymore. KAT It's okay. I mean, it's disgusting, but... it's okay. (...) I've been thinking about what you said. A few weeks ago. About the universe. And how small we are. HENRY You have? KAT Yeah. But... the world is still a really, really big place. In its own way. HENRY Relatively. KAT Yeah. So... maybe it's not quite so small. Even though it is. HENRY That's not a very scientific conclusion. KAT It's not a very scientific feeling. ... HENRY I don't know if I should be happy or sad for you. KAT You don't have to be anything. HENRY I want to be something. KAT Honestly, I haven't really figured it out either. ... HENRY How many more dimes do you have? KAT Um... Four. HENRY I can stay on the phone. If you want. And... we don't have to talk. But, I could just stay on the line. While I pollinate the flowers. Keep you company. KAT That's really nice of you. HENRY They're your dimes. KAT Yeah. I guess they are. Kat feeds another dime into the payphone. They stay on the line as the sounds of the protest outside grow louder. TRANSITION: "THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'" BY BOB DYLAN SCENE 5.5 -A WARNING HENRY Wednesday, May 1st, 1968. Dear Mr. Satterfield, It has been brought to my attention that your academic progress is currently below average. Despite current campus affairs and strike activities, this institution continues to demand scholastic excellence from all students. Please schedule an appointment to discuss the conditions necessary to return to good academic standing. Sincerely, George K. Fraenkel, Dean of the Graduate Faculties, Columbia University. TRANSITION: "THE BEAT GOES ON" BY SONNY & CHER SCENE 6 -MAY 6, 1968 Kat sits, alone in the lab. She smokes one of Henry's cigarettes. Henry enters. He hangs back when he sees Kat. He wasn't expecting her. HENRY You're back. KAT Yep. (...) Where've you been? HENRY I had a meeting with the dean... Kat takes a drag. HENRY Are you smoking? KAT You don't mind, do you? HENRY No. KAT Didn't think so. HENRY Is that one of my cigarettes? KAT I thought you didn't mind? HENRY I don't. Henry stares at her. Like maybe he should say something, but he doesn't know what. KAT What? Tobacco's a plant. Henry chickens out, turns to his chalkboard, starts calculating. KAT Seems like things have been pretty busy around here. HENRY It's just been loud, mostly. KAT I had to cross a picket line to get into my own lab. HENRY Yeah, that's been going on all week. KAT But I'm a union kid. I'm from a union family. We don't cross the line. HENRY It's very disruptive. KAT I am an oozing scab on the kneecap of this university. HENRY ...What? KAT Nothing. Just something I overheard. HENRY From who? KAT Nobody. It's not important. Kat takes a final drag. Stamps out the cigarette. KAT I can't believe I did that. HENRY They're your plants. You can exhale whatever toxins you want on them. KAT I didn't mean the cigarette. HENRY Oh. KAT But, I have to be here. I can't let someone else run my experiment. It's my experiment. And, I have to put my Butler proposal together. So, I have to be here. HENRY It's your lab. KAT That's right. It's my lab. Exactly. (she looks out the window, down at all the students on the lawn) It almost looks kinda fun, though. HENRY It wasn't fun last week when the police showed up. KAT Yeah, I bet. HENRY Campus looked like a war zone, it was... (catching the slip) Oh. I, uh... I didn't mean that. About the war zone. It was... I was just... KAT You don't have to do that. HENRY Sorry. KAT You know I spent two weeks in Ohio, right? I wasn't in Korea. HENRY No, I know that. KAT Then why are you acting so weird? HENRY I always act weird. Henry goes back to the chalkboard. Kat just looks at him. KAT Aren't you finished with that? HENRY No. It's, uh... It's my theory. Disrupted revolutions. Gravitational physics. It's taking longer than I expected. KAT Right. (...) And this is what you were working on. All last week. HENRY Yes. KAT Even with all the noise, and how much you hate the noise. HENRY I did my best. KAT And you crossed the picket line. Every day. You just walked into Havemeyer and kept calculating. HENRY I had work to do. I'm behind on equations. KAT You can't do equations at home? HENRY I seem to recall you being fairly grateful that I was here. When I pollinated all the flowers for you. KAT I was. Grateful. I am. HENRY Okay, then. KAT It's just... You really had no desire to join the protest? HENRY No. KAT The whole student body was shaking their fist at injustice, coming together as a community, and you were just... here. Same as every other day. HENRY It wasn't the whole student body. KAT Most of them. HENRY I don't actually think it was "most". KAT A lot of them. HENRY Okay. KAT So... why don't you care? HENRY I care. KAT But you didn't participate. HENRY That doesn't mean I don't care. KAT Doesn't it, though? HENRY Okay. So... what if I don't? Why do you care so much what I care or don't care about? KAT Because you don't have to care. Everything that's wrong in the world... it doesn't matter, because your corner keeps on spinning. HENRY You weren't involved in the protest either. KAT I would have been. HENRY But, you weren't. KAT But, I would have been. HENRY But, you weren't. You weren't here. So, you don't know. KAT I don't have to know. I know I would have given / anything to be here. HENRY The black students were separated from the whites, did you hear that on the news? KAT ...No. HENRY They had the girls running errands and taking minutes, like secretaries. Mark Rudd was in charge. And when the police got here, they started beating people up. There was blood. Broken arms. Faces getting shoved into concrete. And, it's not like they've canceled finals. This is still an institution of higher learning with GPAs and dissertations and progress reports. So, now, two weeks later, you were in Ohio and you can say whatever you want. But, don't judge me, because you weren't here. And now... what are you even doing here? All your friends are out there, so what are you doing here? A long beat. KAT You're the only one I told. About where I was. And why I went home. I didn't... You're the only one I told. HENRY You didn't tell your friends? KAT They were busy. HENRY And now...? KAT Now I'm just a scab. HENRY I'm sure if you told them... KAT I don't really want to tell them anything. Another long beat. HENRY Your brother's a hero. KAT Yeah. Right. HENRY He is. Kat looks at Henry. Really looks at him. Like she's seeing something she hadn't noticed before. KAT How do you feel about the war? HENRY What? KAT What's your position on Vietnam? HENRY Oh. No. I'm not doing this. This is a trick. KAT I asked you a question. HENRY You never like my answers / to your questions. KAT Just answer it. ... HENRY I don't see what's so bad about // KAT Jesus Christ. Wow. HENRY // helping South Vietnam fight communism. KAT You are fascinating. HENRY I have a lot of respect for the army. KAT Not enough to join. ... HENRY I meant what I said. About your brother. I admire his bravery and his service / to this country-KAT Do you even know his name? HENRY ...Greg? KAT No. HENRY ...Alan. KAT My brother's name is Peter. HENRY I... didn't know that. ... KAT None of this will ever touch you. HENRY If I lose my spot at this school / then it's... KAT You wouldn't, though. Your dad just has to make a donation-.HENRY If I lose my spot, then I am gone. My deferral's only good as long as I'm here and I already got kicked out of one school so there is nowhere else for me to go. KAT …You got kicked out of Dartmouth? HENRY You know what? I don't want to talk about this. KAT You brought it up. HENRY That's not the point. It doesn't... I'm sorry. About what happened to your brother. I am. But, you're just a girl. You'll never be drafted. You could flunk out, get expelled, whatever you want. Drop out and get married. It doesn't matter. But this school? These calculations? The science...? This is what's keeping me alive right now. KAT So, what? You want to be a girl? HENRY I didn't say that. KAT Because I don't think you want to be a girl. Unless you want to be told that you don't matter every day of your entire life. HENRY I didn't mean it that way. KAT Yeah, you did. ... HENRY I just... I don't wanna die. The confession hangs between them for a long moment like a naked, vulnerable thing. KAT The world is such a fucked up place, you know? HENRY I know. Another long beat. KAT Hey, Henry? (...) Thanks for taking care of the plants. HENRY You're welcome. TRANSITION: "NATURE BOY" BY GRACE SLICK & THE GREAT SOCIETY SCENE 6.5 -A PHONE CALL Kat dials the telephone. KAT Hey, it's Kitty. Can I talk to Peter? (...) Yeah, okay. Thanks. (...) Hey. How are you? (...) Yeah, sorry. That was a stupid question. (...) I was gonna write you a letter, but that made it feel like you were still really far away. So, I just figured I'd call. (...) Well, I was thinking about trees. (...) Yeah. And the thing about trees is that they're stuck where they are. They make a decision when they're just tiny little seeds that this is where they're gonna spend the rest of their life. In this one spot. And once they decide, they can't un-decide. They have to survive the winters and the loggers and the forest fires and whatever else comes along. And sometimes a tree can be slashed in half, totally devastated. And still, if you give it time, if the conditions are right... it'll grow. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is just that... trees are really amazing. Life can be so amazing, even when it feels like the entire world is burning. And... I hope you're feeling better. That's what I called to say. (...) Yeah, I don't know. It's stupid. (...) You did? All the way through? Because you have to... (...) What'd you think? (...) I know, it's underground. They're the Velvet Underground, so... (...) Yeah, I knew you'd like that one, you weirdo. TRANSITION: "BABY, NOW THAT I FOUND YOU" BY THE FOUNDATIONS SCENE 7 -MAY 13, 1968 Henry, alone in the lab. Scribbling away, as per usual. The bean plants actually look like beans now. Growing actual beans. Kat enters in a whirlwind of excitement, carrying a stack of books and a shopping bag. She looks like maybe she's in love. KAT I did it. It's done. It's IN THE BAG. HENRY I'm busy right now. KAT My proposal is in! For the Butler Fellowship. Dropped it off this morning, along with a glowing letter of recommendation from Professor Dansereau, which is truly unheard of. He hates everyone, and he’s on the Butler committee. So, my chances could not possibly be better. HENRY Congratulations. KAT What's your problem today? HENRY I don't have a problem. But Kat's still hanging around. KAT I got you a present. As a consolation prize, since you’re not gonna win. She produces a triangular lollipop. KAT It's an Astro Pop. It's meant to look like a rocket or something. HENRY That's a triangle. KAT Just take it. Henry takes it. Kat continues fishing around in her bag. She pulls out a yellow-wrapped chocolate bar. KAT Oh! And this one too. An "Oh Henry" bar. HENRY Thanks. Kat empties out the rest of her bag. Pixy Stix. Sweetarts. Mike & Ikes. Twizzlers. All the 60s candy you can find. HENRY Where'd you get all that? KAT The new Kings-Lion on 113th. They have everything there. And I'm celebrating. Kat rips open some candy and shoves it into her mouth. Henry stares at his chalkboard. KAT You look like you're ready to kill something. HENRY I've been here since 5. KAT In the morning? Jesus. Why. HENRY The equations won't balance. ... KAT You're really lucky, you know that? HENRY Is this about how my parents are rich, / because I'm kind of busy... KAT No. It's just... space. You're lucky. Everyone loves space. Space is sexy. It's got astronauts. And news coverage. And Astro Pops. I mean, you have candy. Ecology doesn't have candy. HENRY I guess. KAT Why do people love space so much? HENRY I don't want to fight with you. KAT We're not fighting. We're talking. I want to know. I'm interested. HENRY I'm kind of in the middle of something... KAT Don't kid yourself, you've been staring at that chalkboard for 5 hours. Henry takes a beat. She's right, he has. The calculations aren't behaving anyway. And she did buy him a lollipop. HENRY Do you believe in God? KAT Um... ha. Yeah. Why? HENRY Space is like God, but better. KAT Wow. Okay. HENRY They're both answers to the same questions. Like... where did we come from? God was our first answer, only, an unscientific and vague one, at best. But with space... the knowledge is infinite. Well. Possibly infinite. Infinity gets complicated. KAT So, where did we come from? According to space. HENRY ...That's a good question. ... KAT I don't think that's the answer. HENRY To... what? KAT Why everyone loves space. I mean, only nerds get excited over existential shit like that. HENRY Star Trek is really popular. KAT No one watches that. HENRY I think it's good. KAT Okay, settle down, Spock. HENRY So you watch it... …Caught. KAT Here's the thing that bothers me about Star Trek. We are so arrogant. To even imagine that a Vulcan would look somewhat like a human being. Come on! Or... okay, or, that a person from Earth could just casually visit another planet like... last week, Pollux IV. No spacesuits required. That's ridiculous. I mean... even just our biochemistry. Our bodies, our senses, the food we eat, the air we breathe... we will never be at home anywhere but Earth. HENRY But... we're not alone. Statistically, especially when you factor in the possibility of infinity... the question of alien life isn't a question of if, but where. KAT This country can't even handle black people. The last thing we need is aliens. HENRY That's not what Star Trek says. KAT Yeah, well, Star Trek isn't real. HENRY But, we're part of something bigger. That's real, and that matters. KAT Does it, though? HENRY Of course it does. We're not the center of the universe. The universe has no center. And it matters. To acknowledge just how small we are. KAT Here's a thought. Maybe we're not that small. Maybe we're the same size we've always been and everything else is just enormous. And maybe we don't have to shrink our importance just because other things are bigger than we are. Size isn't everything. HENRY I guess I never thought about it like that. KAT Men never do. Henry stares at the chalkboard. HENRY I think I took a wrong turn somewhere. KAT It happens. HENRY What if it's useless? What if I've wasted 5 months working on something that will never amount to anything. KAT People make careers out of that. HENRY No. I have to... This has to work. KAT Why? HENRY Because... Because, I'm failing Particle Physics. KAT Seriously? HENRY Yeah. KAT How did you let that happen? HENRY It's Professor Wu. The Dragon Lady, that's what people call her. She's ruthless. And very small. And I find quarks to be a waste of time, frankly. But then everything seems to be a waste of time, so... (...) It was one of the only classes with an open spot when I started and I just... I thought it wouldn't matter. If my theory worked out, then I could drop Particle Physics and no one would care because... I'm an astrophysicist, I don't need bosons. But, I can't flunk with nothing else to show. That's what the dean told me. Otherwise it'll be Dartmouth all over again and they'll send me right back to the Draft Board. KAT So you didn't go to lectures at Dartmouth either. HENRY I really don't like lectures. ... KAT I thought President Kirk was all buddy buddy with your dad. HENRY They're calling for his resignation. Because of the protests. KAT And you think he'll do it? Resign? Henry shrugs. Like he knows something the rest of us don't and he's been explicitly told not to say anything. KAT Shit. Wow. ... HENRY Why do you need a Butler Fellowship, anyway? KAT I don't have a trust fund. HENRY So, it's about money? KAT Tuition is expensive. It's not sustainable, honestly. But... money's just part of it. HENRY What's the other part? KAT Recognition. Validation. Security. HENRY But you don't need academic security. KAT Security is not your personal property. You don't... God, you don't know anything. Henry stares at the chalkboard. HENRY I think I need to start over. KAT Yeah, maybe you do. From offstage, sounds of the protests on the lawn begin to rise. Shouting. Music. Instrumental psychedelic space rock. HENRY What's going on out there? KAT It's the Grateful Dead. HENRY The... who? KAT No, The Who is completely different. HENRY ...What? KAT You know, maybe you should think about coming back down to earth every once in a while. HENRY (a lightbulb, slow and scary) ...Back down to earth. Henry glances over at the chalkboard again, seeing something entirely new this time. KAT Henry. HENRY Hmm? KAT They're a band. They're both bands. HENRY No. Yeah. That's... Right. Sure. Henry gathers up his notebooks and heads for the door. KAT Where are you going? HENRY The library. KAT Do you even know where that is? HENRY The orbits... If I bring them back down to earth, then maybe... (...) I have to start over. KAT What? Henry? Henry! But he's already gone. TRANSITION: "THE ELEVEN" BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD SCENE 7.5 -A PROPOSAL HENRY Friday, May 17th, 1968. To whom it may concern, Enclosed please find my application for the Butler Science Fellowship: "A Theory of Kinetic Orbital Air Strikes and their Non-Prohibitive Classification under the International Outer Space Treaty". Thank you in advance for your consideration. Sincerely, Henry Satterfield. TRANSITION: "I CAN SEE FOR MILES" BY THE WHO SCENE 8 -MAY 31, 1968 Kat sits, holding a letter. Henry enters. HENRY ...Hi. KAT You got a letter. HENRY You opened my mail? KAT I was curious. HENRY That's a federal crime. KAT SO SUE ME. ... HENRY What does it say? KAT You know. Henry reaches for the letter, but Kat pulls it out of his reach. He goes for it again. Kat tries to hang on. KAT No. No. Stop! Henry snatches it from her. He reads. HENRY I'm the Butler Fellow. KAT You are such a bastard. HENRY ...You're mad. KAT Your proposal had nothing to do with galactic fucking orbits. HENRY I would have been happy for you. KAT But, you're not. HENRY But, I would have been. KAT But, you're not. It's your name on the letter. Look... She snatches the letter back from him. HENRY No, don't--! KAT "Congratulations, Mr. Satterfield!" (...) Congratulations. HENRY I earned that. You submitted, and I submitted, and I won. Fair and square. KAT You're building missiles. HENRY No. No. Orbits. I study orbits. And orbital strikes are... I tweaked my research, that's all. I'm not building missiles. I'm not an engineer. KAT You are theoretically building missiles. HENRY You can't theoretically build anything. It's just theory. KAT Theory. Okay, let's talk about theory. You're the Butler Fellow. You've dodged the draft. And theoretically, you've escaped the war. HENRY Yes. / That's the whole point... KAT Theoretically. But in actuality, you've walked right into Vietnam. Kinetic orbital strikes? You're a soldier now. HENRY It's not forever. KAT How could you do that? HENRY I'm just trying to survive! Once I get my PhD, then... I'll go back to cosmology. It's all transferrable and if this is what will keep me out of Vietnam, then I have to take it. KAT ...Yeah. But there's just one thing. HENRY Right. Of course. As always. KAT You're gonna end up killing people. Maybe you won't see it happen, and maybe it won't be for a long time, but you'll have blood on your hands. And you'll have to live with that. HENRY I will always have blood on my hands! There's no way out of this without someone's blood on my hands. KAT Yeah, well. You're looking at your first casualty. HENRY You'll be fine! You'd have just taken up the space anyway. If you were the Butler Fellow, that's one more guy drafted, one more guy dead or blown up, just like your brother. And in this particular case that guy would be me. So why aren't we talking about the blood on your hands? What do you have to protect yourself from? Housework? KAT Wow. (...) You know what... Kat rips up the letter. HENRY No, no, don't! Kat! She lets the pieces fall to the floor. HENRY Why did you do that? KAT Because you wouldn't. Henry gets down on the floor, picks up the pieces. HENRY You can't change anything. It's just a piece of paper. KAT It's a metaphor! HENRY You can apply again next year. KAT Right. Next year. Because then the war will be over. Unless, it's not. Unless there's more war, and another war, and another after that, and I'm just waiting. And how long am I supposed to wait? A year? Two years? Ten? Until I don't take up space anymore? HENRY All you do is take up space! // KAT Oh, please!-.HENRY // You are everywhere. With your plants, and your voice, and your thoughts. So why don't you try not being everywhere. // KAT Yeah, I'll do that. HENRY // Why can't everyone just disappear for 5 minutes so I can have one thing that's mine. KAT You honestly think you don't have anything that's yours? HENRY You ripped up my letter. KAT The entire universe is yours. It listens to you, and it protects you, and it gives you things. And no one's giving me anything. Except bad news and more housework. And it's bullshit, you know? It's bullshit. Because I am giving it everything. And you don't even go to class. HENRY I’m just as smart as you are. Smarter, even. KAT That is such bullshit! Kat shoves him. HENRY Don't touch me. KAT I deserve that fellowship. HENRY You don't deserve anything! And you know why? Because you're not good enough. I was the better choice, and they chose me. A beat like a slap. The words sting because maybe they're true. And then, suddenly, everything deflates. KAT ...Yeah. Yeah, you're right. A long beat. KAT Maybe I should have been a housewife. When I was in high school, I dated this guy named Jimmy. And I could have married him. He would have asked in a heartbeat, and we would have lived a quiet, uncomplicated life. But I didn't want that. I wanted a lab that was mine and a big city and a big adventure. And sometimes, like now, I can just feel that alternate version of me, so close I can almost touch her. And she's small. But, she's happy. I think. Sometimes. But, I didn't choose her. I chose this spot to put down roots and it's just... it's a little colder than I thought it would be. Winter's a little longer. And... I don't know, you know? Maybe I chose wrong. Because... no one else wants to choose me. HENRY Winter always comes. Seasons are just a quirk of our orbit. KAT I don't want to talk about orbits. HENRY Spring's a quirk, too. Spring and summer. KAT I don't want to talk about orbits, okay? Or galaxies. Or black holes. Or Newtonian physics. I don't want to talk about anything. With you. Not anything. So let's just... stop talking. We're not talking anymore. HENRY But... KAT I don't want you here! I never wanted you here. HENRY ...I don't know where else to go. KAT I don't care where you go. Don't go anywhere, actually. Stay here. It's your lab, right? So... I'll go. Kat gathers up her things. HENRY It's your lab, too. KAT I have a lot of friends, okay? And they care about things the way I care about things. So, I don't need you. Stay here and think about missiles, I don't care. But, there's a protest happening right outside, whenever you're done being such a fucking asshole. Kat exits. TRANSITION: "WHAT A WAY TO DIE" BY THE PLEASURE SEEKERS SCENE 8.5 -A BULLETIN KAT June 4th, 1968. Students for a Democratic Society cordially invites you to the COUNTER COMMENCEMENT. All those who will not be attending the college-sponsored graduation ceremony in protest of a corrupt institution should assemble on Low Plaza at 3:30 PM. Strike! Against Racist Trustees! Fascist Cops! Imperialist War! TRANSITION: "BIRTHDAY" BY THE BEATLES Wait. Scratch that. A tangle of radio broadcasts. This one in particular: www.dailymotion.com/video/x36wgqi "We want Bobby! We want Bobby! We want Bobby!" Then... 3 GUNSHOTS in the early morning. "Senator Kennedy has been shot! Is that possible? Is that possible? It is possible. Senator Kennedy has been shot..." TRANSITION: SILENCE... SCENE 9 -JUNE 5, 1968 Kat and Henry sit in the lab, drowning in an extended, pervasive silence. After what feels like an age... KAT Do you think he's gonna die? HENRY I thought we weren't talking. KAT We aren't. (...) But... do you think he's gonna die? HENRY He hasn't died yet, so maybe he won't. KAT It's not supposed to be like this. Bobby Kennedy is supposed to run for President. It's supposed to be... He's not supposed to die. ... HENRY Do you want to put the radio on? KAT No. HENRY Are you sure, because-.KAT No... I can't. Today. I can't. HENRY He's not gonna die. ... KAT Do you remember where you were when you found out Jack Kennedy died? HENRY Yeah. KAT Where? HENRY Um... It was a Friday. Right before Thanksgiving. And my mother... she has these episodes sometimes where she gets... manic. Illogical and wild, kind of. And when she called me at school, I was up at Dartmouth, I thought it was something like that. She was crying a lot. But she told me to turn on the television. And when I did, there was this moment where the tv was just static. And television static is a background of cosmic waves leftover from the big bang. There are echoes of that explosion still hitting our airwaves from 13.7 billion years ago. And when I finally found the news... I could feel this whole new explosion. The weight of it. And how... maybe we'd never get rid of the static. ... KAT Do you think we're gonna remember being here? In this lab. When people ask us where we were? HENRY Maybe. KAT I just want to stop finding myself in these moments, you know? The moments you can't forget. Why are there so many of them. t... HENRY He's gonna die, isn't he. KAT Almost definitely. (...) You got a cigarette? Henry hands her a cigarette. She lights it and takes a drag. KAT You can have one too, don't make me smoke alone. He lights one for himself. They sit side by side for a long time. Smoking like two brick chimneys. KAT You wanna know something really screwed up? HENRY ...What? KAT Today's my birthday. HENRY Really? KAT Yep. June 5th. Not that anyone cares. HENRY Happy birthday. Kat shoots him a look. Like, yeah, right. HENRY Or... not. Not happy birthday. KAT Just shut up. ... HENRY How old are you? KAT I'm 25. HENRY You should have told me. I could've gotten you a present. KAT Why don't you just get your stuff out of my lab. Move your stupid chalkboard over to Pupin. Leave me alone. You're always choking all my plants with your stupid cigarettes. She takes another careful drag. HENRY You could come visit if you want. KAT I don't think so. HENRY Yeah... Yeah. I don't blame you. ... KAT You know, I envy you sometimes. HENRY I can't imagine why. KAT You're going somewhere. I haven't gone anywhere. I'm exactly where I started. You're moving to Pupin at least. Shiny new lab for the shiny new fellow. HENRY Pupin is right around the corner. KAT But it's somewhere, you're going somewhere. HENRY I'm on a collision course. I am going to crash into something colossal. And I am going to be absolutely obliterated. KAT Yeah, well, whose fault is that. HENRY It's my fault. It's all my fault. Henry looks over at the chalkboard. The calculations taunt him. He throws his cigarette at it. It bounces off like nothing. He smacks the board. Starts wiping away all his hard work with his bare hands. Kat stubs out her cigarette and goes to pull him away. KAT Henry! Henry! Stop! Come on. Stop! HENRY I sacrificed everything. All my research... And our... (friendship? or whatever?) All of it. Just so I could stay here and not be there. But I am there, you were right, I am there. And it's... it's never-ending. Where is the end? Kat reaches out, but Henry pulls away. KAT Okay... HENRY I'm sorry. KAT It's okay. HENRY I think there's something really wrong with me. KAT There is nothing wrong with you. HENRY I don't know. KAT It's okay to be angry. It's okay to be sad. It's okay. Henry? Look at me. You are gonna be okay. Kat reaches out again, more tentative this time. Henry lets her. Then, he hugs her. It's a friendship hug, though. Don't let it get sexy. The hug ends. There's a long, awkward beat. HENRY Why are you being so nice to me? KAT I don't know. It's a weird day. ... HENRY Are we friends? KAT What kind of question is that? HENRY It's just a question. KAT I don't know. HENRY I think you're the only friend I have. KAT That's depressing. HENRY I know. KAT We haven't spoken in a week. HENRY I know. KAT I think I might hate you. HENRY I deserve that. ... KAT I don't know what we are. Stuck in each other's orbits, maybe. I don't know. ... HENRY I'm sorry about your birthday. I really like birthdays. KAT Just forget it. HENRY No. It's your 25th birthday. So, that means you've been alive on this earth, traveling around the sun for exactly 25 years. 25 revolutions. And the thing about birthdays is that they don't mark the earth's place in its orbit. I mean, they do, arbitrarily, because they only happen once a year. But they don't, really. Instead, they mark how far you have traveled. You and only you. And also whoever else has your same birthday, but mine's November 7th, so here in this lab it's only you. The earth travels 584 million miles every year, and you're 25, so that's... 14 and a half billion miles, give or take. (...) You're going somewhere. I promise. You are. KAT You're not gonna make any new friends if you keep talking about space like that. HENRY It's a good thing. A birthday. KAT Yeah. Henry picks up his lighter. He lights it, holds it out. KAT Oh god, you're not gonna sing, are you? HENRY Do you want me to? KAT No! HENRY Then make a wish. KAT Today is bad luck. HENRY It's not for today. It's for tomorrow. For your next revolution. Kat takes a beat. Then, she blows out the flame. TRANSITION: "TURN! TURN! TURN!" BY THE BYRDS SCENE 9.5 -SOME MORE FIELD NOTES HENRY Tuesday, June 11th, 1968. Dear Universe, Some infinities are larger than other infinities. There is an infinite quantity of numerical values between 0 and 1, just as there's an infinite quantity of numerical values between 0 and 2. The second infinity is double the first, which makes no sense at all once you consider the definition of infinity as "being infinite. Boundless. Greater than any countable number". Infinity is a construct. A name we've given something we can't fully comprehend. The universe is possibly infinite. Negatively curved and hyperbolic, extending forever. Maybe. Who knows. Well, you'd know. You're the universe. But, then again, maybe you wouldn't. Know. If you were infinite. There are things we can't know. We name them anyway. Even though the name can't encompass everything. Can't possibly. Infinity. Universe. Friend. It's all too much. But still, we try. And I am, as ever, yours. Henry. TRANSITION: "HOMEWARD BOUND" BY SIMON & GARFUNKEL SCENE 10 -JUNE 17TH, 1968 The lab has been cleared out. All the plants are gone. The chalkboard has been wiped clean. Kat packs up a few boxes. The room feels empty and hot with approaching summer. Henry enters. He stands near the door, as if he doesn't quite belong. Because, he doesn't. Not anymore. HENRY Hey. Kat glances up at him. Like she's not surprised. KAT Hey. She goes back to packing. HENRY What happened to all your beans? KAT Experiment's over. They're in the trash. HENRY That seems really sad. KAT Circle of life. Everything dies. (...) What are you even doing here? HENRY I just came to pick up the rest of my stuff. KAT It's over there. I left it for you. All his things have been organized into a neat pile by Kat. But, Henry doesn't move. HENRY You're not staying for the summer? KAT No. I, uh... I'm taking the summer off. HENRY Are you going home? To Ohio? KAT For a while, yeah. I used up all of Dr. Graham's funding, so... I'm taking off. For now. ... HENRY They gave me Eckert. As my advisor. He calculated the lunar orbit for NASA. KAT Wow. That's great. HENRY He's really into IBM machines. I don't know though. I like to do it longhand. KAT Yeah, I know. HENRY ...Yeah. You know. A long beat. Henry wants to say something but he's not sure how. KAT Are you just gonna stand there all day or are you gonna, you know, leave. HENRY No, I'm leaving. But, I, uh... I got you something. For your birthday. Henry fishes around in his things and pulls out a bag of jelly beans. HENRY They're jelly beans. You said ecology doesn't have candy, but... beans are plants. Or... they're seeds? I'm not sure, exactly. But, you love candy and you also love beans, so... I know I'm late, but... happy birthday. KAT That's really thoughtful. HENRY I know. KAT Right. Of course you do. (...) Thanks. HENRY You're welcome. (...) I guess... I'll see you next year. KAT Yeah. Next year. Absolutely. HENRY Are you lying to me? KAT ...I don't know. ... HENRY I'd miss you. If you... I just wanted to say that. That I'd miss you. So... that's it. I'm, uh... Yeah, I'm going. Henry gathers up the last of his things and heads for the door. KAT No, wait. Wait. Just... wait. Kat pulls a small jade plant out of one of her boxes. KAT This is for you. It's jade. For your new lab. It's supposed to be lucky. HENRY Are you sure? KAT If it's lucky? Absolutely not. I'm not sure at all. But...you should have it. Kat slides over the whole box. KAT Take all of it, actually. Just in case. HENRY I couldn't. KAT It's a gift. Several gifts. Congratulations. Good luck. Happy birthday. Happy... I don't know. Happy Arbor Day. Just take it. HENRY But... they're yours. KAT Not anymore. HENRY No. KAT Henry-.HENRY No. You can't... No. KAT I want you to have them. HENRY Maybe I could just... take care of them. While you're gone. And then, in the fall? I'll bring them back. Havemeyer 604. I know where to find you. KAT ...Okay. We could do that. HENRY I don't have to pollinate them, do I? KAT No, you don't. HENRY Because, I could do that. KAT Yeah, I know. But... they'll be fine. On their own. Henry takes the plants. He heads toward the door. But then turns around, one last time. HENRY Hey Kat? (...) Thanks. For the gifts. KAT Yeah, you too. Henry exits. And now there's Kat. Alone in the lab. Just like she wanted. Only... it's different now. Everything's different. She gets the record player going. TRANSITION: "BLACKBIRD" BY THE BEATLES SCENE 10.5 -TWO LETTERS The song continues underneath, like a memory... HENRY Dear Kat, KAT Dear Henry, HENRY 1968 turned out to be not such a great year. KAT I think 1968 was the worst year of my entire life. HENRY On the news, I remember watching them unload the caskets from Vietnam... KAT I remember thinking how on every one of those graves, there'd be two dates. One of them would be a birthday. HENRY I hated my lab in Pupin. KAT I hated that summer in Canton. HENRY It was too quiet. KAT It was so quiet. HENRY They wouldn't let me have a record player. But, I had a radio. KAT My parents still had a black and white tv. HENRY And the news seemed... endless. KAT Helen Keller died. HENRY Saddam Hussein organized a successful coup d’état in Iraq. KAT 10 days before the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, 300 student protesters were murdered by the police. HENRY The Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. KAT The Pope condemned birth control. HENRY The Zodiac Killer was on the loose. KAT And Richard Nixon won the presidential election. HENRY But good things happened too. KAT If you knew where to look. HENRY I made a friend that year. KAT ...I also made a friend that year. HENRY On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 became the first manned spacecraft to enter lunar orbit. While looking out from the Moon, astronaut Bill Anders took a picture. The first ever color photograph of the Earth, glowing blue and white and home to every soul you've ever known, surrounded by the vast black expanse of space. They called it "Earthrise". KAT That's the nerdiest thing I've ever heard. HENRY It was a really good thing. KAT If I had to tell you one good thing that happened, I would tell you that the Beatles released the White Album. "Hey Jude" came out as a single, and on the B Side, there was this song. I played it over and over again, until the vinyl wore out. I loved that song. It was called "Revolution". BLACKOUT: "REVOLUTION" BY THE BEATLES END OF PLAY

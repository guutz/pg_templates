[u][b]About 321 Search[/b][/u]

321 Search began in February 2003 from a post by Paul Underwood seeking help from interested parties in a prime search attempt of the form 3*2^n-1. The initial goal was to build upon the completed work at [url=http://www.prothsearch.com]Proth Search[/url] and extend the list of known primes to an exponent of 1 million (n=1M). That was quickly achieved so they advanced their goal to finding a mega prime for which they sieved up to n=5M.

As seen on [url=http://www.primegrid.com/]PrimeGrid's front page[/url], that goal was achieved on 23 Mar 2008, 7:57:28 UTC, when Dylan Bennett of Canada returned a positive result for n=4235414 (3*2^4235414-1).

PrimeGrid added the +1 form and currently aims to test all candidates of both forms up to n=50M.

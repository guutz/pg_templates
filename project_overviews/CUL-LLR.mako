[u][b]About the Cullen Prime Search[/b][/u]

A Cullen number in the form of n*2^n[b]+[/b]1. Fr. James Cullen first studied these numbers in 1905 because they have interesting divisibility properties. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many n values that will yield Cullen primes, though it has been shown that almost all are composite.

[b][u]About the Sophie Germain Prime Search[/u][/b]

A prime number p is called a Sophie Germain prime if 2p + 1 is also prime. For example, 5 is a Sophie Germain prime because it is prime and 2 Ã— 5 + 1 = 11, is also prime.  These numbers are named after Marie-Sophie Germain, an extraordinary "French mathematician who made important contributions to the fields of differential geometry and number theory and to the study of Fermat's Last Theorem."

We'll be searching the form k*2^n-1.  If it is prime, then we'll check k*2^n+1, k*2^(n-1)-1, & k*2^(n+1)-1. The opportunity to find SG's and Twins in the same subproject is appealing.
